##  Features

1. **Create and Manage Daily Itineraries**
   - Add activities with:
     - Activity name (e.g., "Visit Eiffel Tower")
     - Time slot (e.g., "10:00 AM â€“ 12:00 PM")
     - Location or notes
     - Budget estimate
   - Activities are grouped by trip day and shown in a collapsible format.

2. **Object-Oriented Structure**
   - Uses `TripDay` and `Activity` classes to structure data.
   - Methods like `getBudgetSummary()` and `getActivityList()` help manage each trip day.

3. **Daily Budget Summary**
   - Shows:
     - Total estimated budget
     - Estimated cost per day
     - Remaining budget
   - Uses JavaScript array methods like `.map()`, `.reduce()`, and `.filter()` for calculations.

4. **Async Travel Tip Fetcher**
   - On page load, a random travel tip is shown after a short simulated delay using `async/await`.

5. **Activity Reminder System**
   - Users can set reminders (e.g., 10 minutes before an activity).
   - Each reminder uses a closure to manage its own countdown timer independently.

6. **Local Storage Support**
